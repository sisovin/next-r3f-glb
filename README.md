# Next R3F GLB

## Project Description and Objectives

In this project, we will explore how to load GLB 3D models in React Three Fiber using Next.js. React Three Fiber (R3f) is a powerful library that enables us to create stunning 3D experiences in React applications. We'll dive deep into the process of integrating GLB models into our projects, providing step-by-step instructions and code examples.

To begin, we'll cover the necessary setup and installation of Next.js and React Three Fiber. Once our development environment is ready, we can proceed to load a GLB model and render it in our React components. We'll showcase different techniques to handle model loading, including best practices, optimization tips, and error handling.

Throughout this R3f tutorial, we'll emphasize the importance of leveraging Next.js capabilities to efficiently manage and serve our 3D assets. We'll discuss how to organize our project structure, properly import GLB models, and take advantage of Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities for improved performance. Additionally, we'll explore various React Three Fiber features that enhance the visualization of our GLB models, such as adding lights, shadows, textures, and animations.

By the end of this project, you'll have a solid understanding of how to create dynamic and immersive 3D experiences using R3f, Next.js, and GLB models. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this project will provide valuable insights into loading GLB 3D models in React Three Fiber. Guide me on this journey of building visually stunning and interactive web applications. Let's bring your creativity to life with React Three Fiber and Next.js.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sisovin/next-r3f-glb.git
   cd next-r3f-glb
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage Instructions and Example Code

To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. Create a Scene with React Three Fiber:
   ```jsx
   // components/Scene.js
   import React from 'react';
   import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
   import Model from './Model';
   import Lights from './Lights';
   import Controls from './Controls';

   const Scene = () => {
     return (
       <Canvas>
         <Lights />
         <Model />
         <Controls />
       </Canvas>
     );
   };

   export default Scene;
   ```

2. Load and Render a GLB Model:
   ```jsx
   // components/Model.js
   import React, { useRef } from 'react';
   import { useLoader } from '@react-three/fiber';
   import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader';

   const Model = () => {
     const gltf = useLoader(GLTFLoader, '/path/to/model.glb');
     return <primitive object={gltf.scene} />;
   };

   export default Model;
   ```

3. Enhance Scene with Lighting, Shadows, and Materials:
   ```jsx
   // components/Lights.js
   import React from 'react';

   const Lights = () => {
     return (
       <>
         <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
         <directionalLight position={[10, 10, 5]} intensity={1} />
       </>
     );
   };

   export default Lights;
   ```

4. Add Controls for Interactivity:
   ```jsx
   // components/Controls.js
   import React from 'react';
   import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei';

   const Controls = () => {
     return <OrbitControls />;
   };

   export default Controls;
   ```

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the app, follow these steps:

1. Build the app for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Alternatively, you can deploy the app to a platform like Vercel or Netlify by following their deployment guides.
